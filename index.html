                <h2>Week 6: Making it Work - Adding the Timer Logic with JavaScript</h2>
                <p class="post-meta">Published on: October 12, 2025</p>

                <h3>1. Key Learning Moments</h3>
                <p>
                    My "aha!" moment this week was understanding the `setInterval` function in JavaScript. I never knew how websites updated things every second, and `setInterval` is the key. It lets me run my "update time" function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second). I also learned the math to change total seconds into a "minutes:seconds" format, which was a fun logic puzzle.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Personal Connections</h3>
                <p>
                    I felt so excited when I clicked the "Start" button and the numbers on the clock began to count down. In that moment, my project changed from a static page into a real, working tool. This is the core function of my app idea, and building it myself made me feel closer to my goal of becoming a developer who can create useful things.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Challenges and Growth</h3>
                <p>
                    My biggest problem was a small formatting bug. When the timer's seconds dropped from 10 to 9, my clock showed "15:9" instead of "15:09". It looked unprofessional. To fix it, I learned how to add a "leading zero" if the number is less than 10. This challenge taught me that details are very important and that I can find solutions to problems online.

                <p>
                    I used <strong>Google's Gemini</strong> a lot to help me fix my timer code. I pasted my broken function and asked, "Why is my timer's format wrong?" Gemini quickly found the "leading zero" problem, gave me the correct code, and clearly explained why it worked better. It was like having a smart helper who could find my mistakes and teach me at the same time.

                <h2>Week 5: Building the Skeleton - Creating the App with HTML and CSS</h2>
                <p class="post-meta">Published on: October 5, 2025</p>

                <h3>1. Key Learning Moments</h3>
                <p>
                    This week, I learned how HTML and CSS work together. HTML builds the page's structure, like a skeleton. CSS adds the style, like clothes. A key moment was learning CSS Flexbox. Before, I always had trouble centering things on the page. Flexbox makes it simple to arrange everything perfectly. It felt like learning a superpower.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Personal Connections</h3>
                <p>
                    This was the first time I turned my idea from last week into something I could actually see. The app doesn't work yet, but seeing the big "90:00" timer on the screen felt amazing. It was fun to create a real thing from my own idea, not just doing homework. It felt like I was building a real product.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Challenges and Growth</h3>
                <p>
                    My biggest challenge was making the app look good on phones. It looked perfect on my big computer screen, but it was a mess on a small mobile screen. I spent a lot of time learning about `@media` queries to apply different styles for different screen sizes. This was hard, but now I understand that I must always design for mobile users first.
                </p>

                    I used <strong>ChatGPT</strong> to help me build the page layout. I described what I wanted, like: "Give me the Flexbox CSS for a header, a main section, and a footer." It gave me good starting code quickly. This saved me time and let me focus on the fun parts of the design.

                <h3>1. Key Learning Moments</h3>
                <p>
                    This week, my learning focus shifted from mastering specific coding techniques to a broader 'product mindset.' The key concept that resonated with me is that a good application isn't just a collection of code, but a thoughtful solution born from a deep understanding of user needs. I spent a lot of time thinking about <em>why</em> people get distracted, and how a simple timer with a core feature of 'random reminders' could genuinely help users return to a state of focus. This process made me realize that clearly defining the 'problem' and the 'solution' is crucial before writing the first line of code.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Personal Connections</h3>
                <p>
                    The idea for this app stems directly from my own struggles. While learning to code, I often find myself unconsciously picking up my phone or opening unrelated tabs, which hurts my productivity. Traditional Pomodoro timers sometimes feel too rigid for me. I wanted to create a tool that provides a long, immersive work block (90 minutes, based on ultradian rhythm theories) while also gently pulling me back on track in an unpredictable way. This is more than just a programming exercise; it's an attempt to build a solution for myself and for others who face the same challenge.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Challenges and Growth</h3>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge wasn't technical, but conceptual: how to design the 'random sound' feature so that it serves as a helpful reminder instead of becoming a new source of distraction. I considered different sound types (like a soft chime or a water drop) and the random time intervals for the alerts (should it be completely random, or random within a specific range?). To work through this, I sketched out a User Flow Diagram, simulating the entire user experience from starting the timer to finishing the rest period. This process forced me to think about every detail from the user's perspective, marking a small but significant step for me from being just a 'code implementer' to becoming a 'product designer.'

                <p>
                    During the ideation phase, I used <strong>Miro (an online whiteboard tool with AI features)</strong> for brainstorming. I created a mind map to organize the app's core features, target users, and potential challenges. When I got stuck, I used Miro AI's 'expand idea' feature. I typed in the prompt 'how to make alerts non-intrusive,' and it generated several keywords for me, such as 'ambient sounds,' 'adjustable frequency,' and 'subtle visual cues.' These suggestions significantly broadened my thinking and helped me design the app's core experience more holistically.

                <h2>Week 3: Putting Theory into Practice - Building My First Interactive Component</h2>
                <p class="post-meta">Published on: September 7, 2025</p>

                <h3>1. Key Learning Moments</h3>
                <p>
                    This week, the focus shifted entirely from theory to practice. The activity that resonated most was building a simple to-do list application. This process gave me a deep understanding of how different concepts connect: HTML for structure, CSS for style, and JavaScript as the glue that brings it to life. For the first time, I clearly felt the power of DOM manipulation—dynamically creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) elements on the page with JavaScript. It was more exciting than any isolated exercise before it.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Personal Connections</h3>
                <p>
                    This hands-on project connects directly to my long-term goal of becoming a front-end developer. It was no longer an abstract code snippet but a tangible 'product' I could see and interact with. This small success significantly boosted my confidence and made me believe in my ability to turn ideas into reality. It also got me thinking about my personal portfolio; while this to-do list is simple, it serves as a cornerstone for the more complex applications I plan to build.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Challenges and Growth</h3>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge appeared when handling user input and event listeners. Initially, my code worked for adding new tasks, but when I tried to delete a specific one, it would either delete the wrong item or not react at all. I spent an entire afternoon using `console.log()` to trace the values of variables and the execution flow of my functions step-by-step. I eventually discovered a logical error in how I was getting the index of the clicked element. While the process of fixing this bug was frustrating, it taught me how to debug systematically and showed me the importance of using the browser's developer tools. This was where I experienced the most growth.

                    I used <strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> to assist with coding during this challenge. When I got stuck on a tricky JavaScript function, instead of asking it to write the entire code, I first wrote my goal in a comment (e.g., `// function to find and remove an item from the todos array by its id`). Copilot then generated a very clean and efficient code suggestion. I carefully studied its suggested code and compared it to my original approach. This not only solved my problem but also taught me a more optimized way to write it. In this context, it acted like a senior pair programmer.

                <p>
                    This week, the concept of 'asynchronous operations' in JavaScript finally clicked. The discussion around the event loop and how callbacks, promises, and `async/await` all interact was a major breakthrough. The activity where we had to refactor a callback-heavy function to use `async/await` was particularly insightful; it demonstrated the dramatic improvement in readability and maintainability.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Personal Connections</h3>
                <p>
                    This connects directly to my goal of building more responsive and efficient web applications. In past projects, I've run into issues with slow, blocking operations that froze the user interface. Understanding asynchronicity gives me the tools to prevent that, which will be critical for the personal portfolio project I'm planning.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Challenges and Growth</h3>
                <p>
                    My main challenge was debugging a promise chain that wasn't resolving in the order I expected. I spent a couple of hours trying to console.log my way through it. I worked through this by drawing out the execution flow on a whiteboard, step-by-step. This visual approach helped me identify a `.then()` block that was missing a `return` statement, which broke the chain. It was a frustrating but valuable lesson in careful debugging.
                </p>

                    I used **Google's Gemini** this week to enhance my reflection. After struggling to articulate my challenge, I prompted Gemini: "Explain the common pitfalls of JavaScript promise chains in simple terms." Its clear explanation, which included the 'missing return' issue, helped me structure my thoughts and write the 'Challenges and Growth' section with more clarity and technical accuracy.

                <p>
                    The most resonant concept this week was the fundamental difference between 'declarative' and 'imperative' programming paradigms. Seeing the same problem solved both ways highlighted how a declarative approach (like in HTML or SQL) focuses on the 'what', while an imperative approach (like in vanilla C) focuses on the 'how'. The in-class discussion comparing React components (declarative) to jQuery DOM manipulation (imperative) was a real lightbulb moment.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Personal Connections</h3>
                <p>
                    This relates to my interest in user interface design. A declarative mindset seems much more aligned with designing components and states, rather than manually writing step-by-step instructions to change every little thing on the screen. It feels like a more organized and scalable way to think about building complex UIs.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Challenges and Growth</h3>
                <p>
                    I found it difficult at first to grasp the scope of variables in our initial coding exercises. I kept declaring variables inside loops, expecting them to be accessible outside, which led to several errors. I worked through it by reading the official documentation and deliberately practicing with small, isolated code snippets until the rules of block-level vs. function-level scope became second nature.
                </p>

                <h3>4. AI Tool Documentation</h3>
                <p>
                    I used **ChatGPT** to help brainstorm analogies for the declarative vs. imperative concept. I prompted it to "Provide five real-world analogies to explain declarative vs. imperative programming." It gave me several useful examples (like ordering a pizza vs. giving the chef a step-by-step recipe), which helped solidify my understanding and gave me a great way to explain it in my notes.
